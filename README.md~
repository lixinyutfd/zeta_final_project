## How to Run

_Make absolutely certain that the version of learning___ros repository being used is the repository clone located inside this package!_

0. In all terminals used, make sure to identify Merry's roscore.
1. From the command line, run `roslaunch zeta_object_finder zeta.launch`. Wait for this to complete before moving to the next step.
2. In a new terminal tab/window, run `rosrun zeta_object_finder zeta_coordinator`. Make certain the table is properly aligned in front of Merry.
3. Once the coordinator has loaded, it will ask the user if they are ready to detect blocks. Place a block on the table and enter `1`.
4. When Merry has completed her motions, the user will be prompted to return Merry to her starting pose by entering `1`. From here, the user can repeat step 3.
5. Press `0` instead of `1` to end the coordinator. Close all other terminals when finished.

Enjoy!
